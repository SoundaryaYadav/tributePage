                <strong>Full name of 'Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam' was 'Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam'. He was born on October
                    15, 1931 at Dhanushkothi in the temple town Rameshwaram in Tamil Nadu. He was born in a poor family,
                    but he was an exceptionally brilliant child. Kalam passed the B.Sc. examination from Saint Joseph College,
                    Thiruchirapalli. He joined Madras Institute of Technology (MIT). His further knowledge in the field got
                    upgraded when he joined Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) in 1958 and Indian Space
                    Research Organization (ISRO) in 1963. He is known as the Missile Man of India. The various Indian Missiles
                    of world order like Prithvi, Trishul, Akash, Agni, etc. are mainly the result of his efforts and caliber.
                    Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam became the 11th President of India. He served the country from 2002 to 2007. For
                    his excellence and brilliance, he was awarded the prestigious Bharat Ratna in 1998; Padma Vibhushan in
                    1990; and Padma Bhushan in 1981. Dr Kalam expired on Monday 27 July 2015. He suddenly fell unconscious
                    when he was delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management at Shillong. On 30 July 2015,
                    the former President was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground with full state honours. Over
                    350,000 people attended the last rites, including the Prime Minister, the governor of Tamil Nadu and
                    the chief ministers of Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was mainly interested
                    in work. He was a bachelor. He was not interested in going abroad. He wanted to serve his motherland
                    first. He said that he thinks his first and foremost duty is to serve his motherland. He was fond of
                    music and the Koran and the Gita. Ever since becoming the head of the Indian State, he had been having
                    interaction with children all over the country. He was by no means a miracle man. His advice to the youngster
                    of the nation was to "dream dream and convert these into thoughts and later into actions". </strong>
